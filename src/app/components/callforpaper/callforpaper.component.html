        The conference does not accept or encourage the submission of Survey or Review articles. We aim to maintain a
        focus on
        high-quality, original research that contributes new insights and advances in the field of Sustainable
        Technology.

        Prospective authors are strongly encouraged to submit innovative and high-quality research papers for
        presentation at
        the conference. Authors should ensure that their work represents original contributions to the field and is not
        under
        review elsewhere. Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format, with a maximum length of 6 pages, formatted in
        A4
        size. All submissions must adhere to the standard IEEE manuscript template, which includes detailed formatting
        guidelines for authors to follow. The final submission deadline is on or before 30th November 2024, and late
        submissions will not be entertained. Authors can download the required manuscript template by visiting the link
