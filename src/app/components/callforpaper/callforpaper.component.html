      <p>
        The conference does not accept or encourage the submission of Survey or Review articles. We aim to maintain a focus on
        high-quality, original research that contributes new insights and advances in the field of Sustainable Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prospective authors are strongly encouraged to submit innovative and high-quality research papers for presentation at
        the conference. Authors should ensure that their work represents original contributions to the field and is not under
        review elsewhere. Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format, with a maximum length of 6 pages, formatted in A4
        size. All submissions must adhere to the standard IEEE manuscript template, which includes detailed formatting
        guidelines for authors to follow. The final submission deadline is on or before 30th November 2024, and late
        submissions will not be entertained. Authors can download the required manuscript template by visiting the link

        (CMT). Every paper submitted will be peer-reviewed by an expert panel of reviewers, selected from diverse domains
        relevant to Sustainable Technology. Each manuscript will undergo a rigorous review process to ensure that only
        high-quality papers are selected for presentation. Authors are requested to prepare their manuscripts carefully and
        ensure compliance with all submission guidelines. To submit papers, kindly use the Microsoft CMT platform, accessible

        Accepted papers will be presented during the conference and included in the official conference proceedings. Selected
        high-quality papers may also be considered for publication in reputed journals, following the conference. We look
        forward to your participation and contributions, which will enrich the discussions and outcomes of the International
        Conference on Sustainable Technology and Conclave.
